# Inheritance (Python)

A simple Python example demonstrating class inheritance. A base `Animal` class defines shared attributes and behaviors, and `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Mouse` subclasses extend it with their own `speak()` methods.

## What it shows
- Inheriting attributes (`name`, `is_alive`) from a parent class
- Reusing parent methods (`eat()`, `sleep()`, `die()`)
- Overriding/adding subclass behavior (`speak()`)

## How to run
```bash
python inheritance.py
Sample behavior
The script creates a dog, cat, and mouse, then prints their names, life status, and calls inherited methods.
